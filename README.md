# Zesterer's Volumetric Cloud & Mist Mod for [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/en/)

A mod that adds raycasted volumetric clouds to Morrowind.

The goal of this mod, aside from looking pretty, is to enhance the perception of the world's scale. High view
distances are great, but they ruin the sense of immersion and mystery. Equally, a low, static view distance has the
opposite problem: you never get the opportunity to see the sights. With this mod, you'll experience the best of both
worlds: mystery and intrigue, with occasional moments of wonder when the mist clears and you can see for miles.
